Unit Test Abstraction codebases

This Github repo will contain source bases for the 2017 Agile Technical Conference to be held April 19-21 in Boston, MA, US.

Here's a link to a page summarizing my talk, which will be Thursday afternoon (April 20) at 3:20pm:

I see that Uncle Bob is presenting at the same time. Bob is highly entertaining, and SOLID is good stuff, but if you've seen either, come to this talk and have fun whittling some nasty tests into something you'll want to maintain!

See how long it takes you to spot the nasty test class that we'll be shaping up.

## Java

Good to go! Feel free to clone, but realize that you might need to pull prior to my talk.

## C# #

NOTE WELL: *As long as you see this comment, the source here is not ready for downloading--it is a work in progress.* Now that the Java version looks good, I will produce a C# equivalent; figure on sometime by the end of February 17. Or Feb 24 at the latest.
