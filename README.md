Unit Test Abstraction codebases

This Github repo will contain source bases for the 2017 Agile Technical Conference to be held April 19-21 in Boston, MA, US.

## The Talk

Here's a link to a page summarizing my talk, which will be Thursday afternoon (April 20) at 3:20pm:

I see that Uncle Bob is presenting at the same time. Bob is highly entertaining, and SOLID is good stuff, but if you've seen either, come to this talk and have fun whittling some nasty tests into something you'll want to maintain!

## The Codebase

This is the start of an app I'm building for the Raspberry Pi. It manages a home pantry. At some point it will allow for scanning of barcodes; right now it looks up UPC codes using an open API, and returns basic product details. The primary goal will be to track when items are near expiration.

See how long it takes you to spot the nasty test class that we'll be shaping up.

## Java

Good to go! Feel free to clone, but realize that you might need to pull prior to my talk.

## C# #

NOTE WELL: *As long as you see this comment, the source here is not ready for downloading--it is a work in progress.* Now that the Java version looks good, I will produce a C# equivalent; figure on sometime by the end of February 17. Or Feb 24 at the latest.
